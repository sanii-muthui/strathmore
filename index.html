      <h1>A SECTRET LOVE STORY</h1>
    <p>As Days pass by, the memory of Us as Strangers Again Crumbles a FairyTale that Hunts down my Frozen Heart.<br>
        Perhaps i was too nice with you and ended up Loving a fantasy of my own "ghost" Town.<br>
        We are A million miles apart and still you are my perfect Adventure. <br>
        Your name causes an illusion of an angel's hell in my Heart and i am stuck in this brutal infatuation that never seems to end,<br>
        Knowing you Gave me A Home to conceal my Loneliness,a portion i didn't realise i will covet till eternity.<br>
        Every Flower i see as days turn into months blooms your name and my dead soul awakens with delectation.<br>
        *******<br>
        A Beautiful Black child ,your love  breaks Hearts the moment anyone stares into those glistening eyes even all stars seem to stoop down<br>
        to you for the power you have burns down all souls,A colour scheme that made me blind with a million feelings to show you How much of<br>
        a masterpiece Art you are everytime i am around your Aura. Maybe one day we will rebuild old moments and turn them into beautiful memories for<br>
        i am starving for your connection for there is nothing special in this unremitting toil without you being a part of it.<br> 
        In my Heart a spell of our Love is bound till we meet again.<br>
        Goodbye my secret love Flower.</p>
